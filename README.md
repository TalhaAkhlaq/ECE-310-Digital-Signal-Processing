# Digital Signal Processing

## Overview
Discrete-time signal processing theory and design: transforms, spectral analysis, sampling/multirate processing, filter design/realization, quantization effects, and media-signal applications.

## Topics
- Laplace and z-transforms
- Fourier analysis; multidimensional signals/systems
- Minimum-phase and all-pass functions
- Analog filters; digital IIR/FIR design
- Sampling; multirate systems; filter banks
- A/D and D/A models
- Discrete-time state-space; filter structures
- Quantization effects and mitigation
- DFT/FFT; spectral analysis (deterministic/random)
- Adaptive filtering (intro)
- Differential/transform coding; speech/audio/video signals
